# Midnight Jazz

A mellow exploration of jazz harmonies filtered through lo-fi production techniques, *Midnight Jazz* creates an intimate atmosphere perfect for quiet evening reflection.

## Musical Elements

- **Piano**: Warm, slightly detuned electric piano with vintage character
- **Bass**: Subtle upright bass simulation with natural room tone
- **Drums**: Soft, brushed percussion with vinyl-style crackle
- **Atmosphere**: Subtle field recordings and ambient room tone

## Style & Approach

This composition draws from classic jazz standards while incorporating modern lo-fi production aesthetics. The piece features:

- Extended jazz harmonies (7th, 9th, and 11th chords)
- Relaxed swing rhythm with subtle timing variations
- Warm analog-style saturation and tape compression
- Vintage reverb algorithms for spatial depth

## Recording Notes

Created entirely "in the box" using:
- Native Instruments Vintage Electric Pianos
- Kontakt upright bass samples
- Custom drum kit processed through tape emulation
- iZotope Vinyl for lo-fi character

The mix intentionally features slightly compressed dynamics and rolled-off high frequencies to achieve the characteristic lo-fi warmth.

*Perfect for late-night work sessions, reading, or relaxation.*
