# Forest Walk

*Forest Walk* is an ambient composition that combines live acoustic guitar performances with carefully curated field recordings from Pacific Northwest forests. The piece aims to capture the meditative quality of walking through old-growth woodland.

## Sound Sources

### Field Recordings
- Bird songs recorded at dawn in Olympic National Park
- Wind through Douglas Fir canopies
- Distant creek water over stones
- Footsteps on forest floor debris

### Instrumental Elements  
- **Acoustic Guitar**: Fingerpicked patterns with natural harmonics
- **Flute**: Sparse, breathy textures following bird melodies
- **Strings**: Subtle drone layers created with bowed guitar

## Recording Process

The field recordings were captured using a Zoom H5 recorder with windscreen during a 3-day backpacking trip. The stereo imaging preserves the spatial relationships of the natural environment.

Acoustic instruments were recorded in a home studio treated to minimize reflections, allowing the natural forest reverb to dominate the soundscape.

### Technical Approach

- **Minimal Processing**: Light EQ and compression to preserve natural dynamics
- **Spatial Design**: Careful panning to create depth and movement
- **Mastering**: Gentle limiting while maintaining the quiet passages

## Compositional Intent

Rather than traditional song structure, this piece follows the organic flow of a forest walk - moments of activity (bird calls, wind) alternating with peaceful interludes. The guitar patterns echo the rhythmic patterns found in nature.
